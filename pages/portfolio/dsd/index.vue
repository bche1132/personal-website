These questions are inspired by the National Governors Associationâ€™s Roadmap to Recovery Report  and will be a growing list as more data is assembled. Use the map to find information about COVID-19 cases for your area of interest. You can also add multiple locations to the dashboard to be able to easily compare COVID-19 information for those areas.</h2>
