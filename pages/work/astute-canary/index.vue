                  The pandemic of 2020 showed a gap in the market for early warning systems at an organizational level.
                  Astute Canary aimed to close that gap. The design and development team worked together to quickly pull together a proof-of-concept risk assessment dashboard and an open-source syndromic community tracker.

                    Engaging early and often with target users was key to approaching our competing and shifting targets.
                    When the design process started, there was a clear focus on syndromic tracking. However after talking to users, we were able to prioritize the risk assessment dashboard.

                  The team shifted with the needs of the users in the ever-changing landscape of global health.
                  Initially focusing on the syndromic-community-tracker, engagement with users enabled the focus to pivot to the higher-impact risk dashboard prototype.
                  We engaged with Fortune 500 companies such as International SOS to develop the proof-of-concepts and open-sourced the <a class="text-blue-800 underline" href="https://github.com/mitre/astute-canary-SCT">syndromic-community-tracker</a>.

                <p class="mt-8 mb-4 text-left text-gray-800 text-lg max-w-screen-md leading-8 font-thin">
                    This project reinforced the importance of adaptability in a rapidly evolving landscape. By engaging with users early and often, I saw firsthand how initial assumptions about needs can shift dramatically. While syndromic tracking seemed like the obvious focus, user feedback helped us prioritize a higher-impact solutionâ€”the risk assessment dashboard.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-left text-gray-800 text-lg max-w-screen-md leading-8 font-thin">I also learned the value of balancing multiple priorities within a startup-like environment. Working on design, outreach, and product development simultaneously required strong collaboration and flexibility. Additionally, navigating challenges around data quality and consistency highlighted the importance of reliable data sources when building decision-making tools.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-8 text-left text-gray-800 text-lg max-w-screen-md leading-8 font-thin">Overall, this experience deepened my understanding of user-centered design, agile development, and the necessity of staying responsive to market needs in high-stakes situations.
